Hi there, very quiet channel! At RLS, we archive channels that have been quiet for 60 straight days via a process called Destalinator. This channel has been quiet for the last 30 days. Tidying up makes it easier for newer folks to find their way around. No content is lost when a channel is archived. If this channel is needed again, it can be unarchived by any user here. If you'd like to keep this channel active, *PLEASE START AN ON TOPIC CONVERSATION* and we'll reset the timer.
